# Translating mypaint

[![Translation status](https://hosted.weblate.org/widgets/mypaint/-/svg-badge.svg)](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/mypaint/?utm_source=widget)

MyPaint uses WebLate for its translations.
You can get involved at <https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/mypaint/>.

That might be all the information you need
if you just want to help ensure that MyPaint
is correctly translated into your language.

# Information for coders and maintainers

We use [GNU gettext][gettext] for runtime translation of program text.

Please note that there are two projects that need translating for the
MyPaint app:

* libmypaint, the brush engine library that MyPaint uses.
* MyPaint itself.

both projects are exposed on WebLate.

The rest of this document covers translating
the MyPaint application itself, minus libmypaint.

## After updating program strings

After changing any string in the source text which makes use of the
gettext macros, you will need to manually run

    cd po/
    ./update_potfiles.sh

    ./update_languages.sh

and then commit the modified `po/mypaint.pot` & `po/*.po` too,
along with your changes.

The `.pot` file alone can be updated by running
just the first command,
if all you want to do is compare diffs.

# Information for translators

## New translation (manual)

Start by putting a new stub `.po` file into this directory.

To make such a file you can
copy the header from an existing `.po` file
and modify it accordingly.

Unless there are several country-specific dialects for your language,
the file should be named simply `ll.po`
where "ll" is a recognized [language code][ll].

If there are several dialects for your language,
the file should be named `ll_CC.po`
where "CC" is the [country code][CC].

Before you can work on it,
you will need to update the `.po` file
from the most recent `.pot` template file
generated by the developers.

## Update translation (manual)

Before working on a translation,
update the `po` file for your language.
For example, for the French translation, run:

    update_languages.sh fr.po

## Use/Test the translation

After modifying the translation,
you can run MyPaint in demo mode to see the changes:

    python setup.py demo

If you want to run MyPaint with a specific translation on Linux,
here are two ways of doing so:

You can either use the LANG environment variable
like this (the locale needs to be supported):

	LANG=ll_CC.utf8 python setup.py demo

where "ll" is a [language code][ll], and and "CC" is a [country code][CC].

If you don't have to locale of the language you want
to test installed, you can use the LANGUAGE variable
instead:

	LANGUAGE=ll_CC python setup.py demo

> You don't have to supply the country code (CC) if you
> don't need to disambiguate multiple dialects.

> When using `LANGUAGE` without having the locale installed,
> some strings that are not part of MyPaint will not be translated.
> For example, button strings in file chooser dialogs.

To run MyPaint with the original strings, for comparison,
you can use the `LC_MESSAGES` variable like this:

    LC_MESSAGES=C python setup.py demo

## Send changes (manual)

Before you send your changes, please make sure that
your changes are based on the
current development (git) version of MyPaint.

We prefer changes as [Github pull requests][PR],
but if you do not know git you can also [open a new issue on github][NEW_ISSUE]
and attach either a unified diff or the new/updated .po file to it.

## Weblate

Weblate provides a browser-based interface for adding, editing
and updating translations. It's a very good way to provide
translations without having to worry about the technical details.
